The purpose of this project is to apply the CRISP-DM process to study listings data. As a quick recap, CRISP-DM is based on 6 important points : 

* 1.Business Understanding
* 2.Data Understanding
* 3.Prepare Data
* 4.Model Data
* 5.Results
* 6.Deploy

A blog post was made on medium to present the overral procedure and some of the results :

We will try to evaluate the given data and to fill in each step of the CRISP-DM to practice our skills and to learn more about data science .

## Installation 

Necessary libraries are as follow : 

```
pip install pandas 
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn
pip install statsmodels
pip install scipy
pip install sklearn 

```

## Project Motivation

You are the end user and you want a tool to compare your available choices. You can use this model to predict how the price might vary from one place to the other before even checking up on the lists

You also can be a home owner and you want to estimate how much you should realisticly ask as a price. Pretty handy analysis ?

## File Descriptions

The project's folder contain the following files : 

* notebook.ipynb
* calendar.csv
* listings.csv
* reviews.csv

## technical details
The following project was executed by folowing these steps : 

* Select relevent data from each dataframe
* define quality issues within dataset
* Correct the issues by using a Clean/test methodology
* EDA on cleaned data to further study the content for feature engineering
* Feature engineering
* Modeling of data and  multicolinearity analysis
* Visualisation and extraction of conclusion from modeling
